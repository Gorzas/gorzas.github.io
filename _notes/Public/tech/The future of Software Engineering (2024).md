### Context

There's an interesting [article](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/what-is-old-is-new-again) published by [Gergely Orosz](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/) That talks about the current state of the Tech Ecosystem and the future ahead for software engineers. In [the talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpPPHDxR9aM) he gets deeper in the reasons and what we could do the software developers in the current tech state.

The main concern for a Software Engineer right now is that less investments in Tech Startups and companies means less jobs and opportunities for developers. Not only we are seeing a descend in salaries, we also see that it gets harder to get a new position.

### The future of Software Engineering

[Gergely Orosz](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/) talks about the new reality for software Engineers and he sees the following:

- An investment in boring technologies and monoliths over "cool stuff" and microservices.
- With [[TypeScript]], we can see a raise of Full Stack developers, meaning we would see developers doing: backend, web, Android and iOS. He talks about React Native and Flutter.
- Responsabilities "shiffting left", this means there are going to be less specialized teams (i.e. DevOps + Frontend + QA) and we would see more shared responsibilities. A Software Engineer should now be responsible of more areas: CI/CD, testing, coding...
- As a side note as a personal concern: he doesn't see AI replacing developers anywhere.


A software engineer, in 2024, now shouldn't be specialized in a specific area, less in a specific framework. As a software engineer looking for new jobs positions should focus in:

- TypeScript + React Native/Flutter (or any other fullstack framework)
- Android & iOS development
- CI/CD (Github workflows, Azure, AWS)
- Deployments
- Databases (SQL, NoSQL)
- Backend development (going to JavaScript/TypeScript, maybe NextJS)
- Testing (Jest, Cypress, Mocha) and testing strategies (TDD, BDD)
