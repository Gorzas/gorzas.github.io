### Questions

- What are Large Language Models and how they work?
- Could I create an app using AI? What are their limits and their advantages?
  - What are real examples where the AI could be useful?
    - **Useful** (needs examples): creating unit/e2e tests, building scripts to avoid repetitive actions (not in the core code), explaining code, helping with documentation, (maybe) code review.
    - **Not useful** (needs examples): building code architecture, code stability and scalability, UX, getting value from a user story.
- What's GPT-3/4?
