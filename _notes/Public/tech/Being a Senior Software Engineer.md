- Definition of Senior Software Engineer:
  - why Engineer over Developer?
  - Senior as a concept that encapsulates Mid, Staff or any lead role that mixes managment with development
- Relation with [[The future of Software Engineering (2024)]] and differences
- Perks to explain:
  - Communication / Documentation
  - T-Shape profile and how to get it
  - Owning the product, features priorities selection
  - Responsabilities over QA and Automatic testing
  - Tech knowledge
  - CI/CDs usage
  - Architecture
  - Code reviews and mentoring, how to do it well
- Things to research:
  - Dependability of coworkers: what is a balanced dependability with coworkers when working in the same system? (I know that, when working in a team, being an "independent developer" isn't impossible but this research work should look for a balanced framework where somebody could be as realistic and optimal independent when working inside a team).
