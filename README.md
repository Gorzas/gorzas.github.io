## Architecture for notes

The idea is to follow a similar structure per note making easier for the user to find the important information. **This is no mandatory** as it could find cases with different needs.

A proposal for sections:

```
## Context

...

## Problem

...

## Solution(s)

...

## References

...
```

Recommended to use `h2` for main sections and `h3` for possible subsections.
